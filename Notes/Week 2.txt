Azure:
    - Manage Azure
        - Azure portal
        - Azure CLI
        - VS & VS Code
    - Everything needs to be parts of "resource group"
        - We create : Resource Group > SQL Server > SQL Database
            - Every resource groups is part of a subscription
            - Database name scoped within resource group
            - Server name must be unique

Data:
    - .Net
        - Classes / Objects / Collections
        - Fields/Variables to store referenced to other data
    - Text formats like xml/json
        - heirarchical containers with attributes
    - Relational Database
        - Like a spreadsheet
            - no heirarchical structure
        - Represent identity with primary keys
        - Represent relationships with foreign keys
        - Tables / rows / columns
            - Unnormalized
                - Update anomaly : you modify all copies but miss one and data becomes inconsistant
                - Deletion anomaly : you delete one piece of data and it deletes additional data because of db structure
                - Insertian anomaly : your unable to store certain pieces of data without also having others
                - Slow searching / performance issues because unstructured data
            - Normalized : taking from unstructured to structured and follow rules
                - 6 Normal Forms : 1-3 are the practical ones
                    - 1NF
                        - all elements are atomic values, not lists/groups/sets. break them up to more rows
                        - each row must be unique
                        - adding new columns to split groups is not motivated and informally violates 1NF
                    - 2NF
                        - all cols which are not part of any candidate key, cannot have partial Dependency on any of the candidate keys
                        - all have to be fully dependent on every can candidate key
                        - if no composite keys, 1NF implies 2NF
                    - 3NF
                        - no non-CanKey column can depend on any other non-CanKey column
                        - No Transitive Dependency
                            - an indirect Dependency A -> B, B -> C so dep from A -> C

Referential Integrity: no broken references
    - every foreign key value should actually point to somthing in another table

Functional Dependency: a relationship between two pieces of data or attributes : (X -> Y) y is dependent on xs
    - for any value of X theres only one possible value of Y
    - Could be sets of columns not just individual columns

    - Candidate Key : a minimal set of col/attr that every other column is dependent on
        - minimal size : (not (name, phone) only (name) or (phone))
        - often set is just size 1 
        - the values of anu Candidate key can uniquely identify that row
            - if key has multiple columns, also can be called a composite key
    - Primary Key : one of the canidate keys to be official identifier
        - underline column to show its primary key
    - Foreign Key : a copy of the primary key to reference the row in another table

SQL : Structured Query Language
    - allows very abstract operations in a relation db
    - Variants:
        - MySQL
        - PostgreSQL - open source
        - Oracle SQL - used by java
        - SQLite - lightweight
        - *SQL Server (Transact-SQL) - Microsoft .NET
            - sql server is software/runtime
            - t-sql is language
            - connects to .NET with Object-relational mapper(ORM)
                - ORM is called Entity Framework
        - Data Manipulation Language (DML)
            - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE
            - these commands all operate on rows of tables.
        - Data Definition Language
            - CREATE, ALTER, DROP
            - these commands operate on other objects, like entire tables, or functions, views, etc.
        - Data Control Language (DCL) manages permissions/users/auth
            - GRANT, REVOKE
    - Semi colons (;) not requires
    - Line breaks and spacing doesnt matter
    - Not case sensitive
    - Single Quotes '' = VARCHAR or string literal
    - Double Quotes " " = Group data : could also use [full name]
    - = NULL is always false (even NULL = NULL)
        - Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL to check
    - Comments:
        - -- (2 dashes) single line commeny
        - /**/ block comment
    - Operators:
        - OPS : < <= = >= >
        - Not equals : != or <>
        - Boolean : AND OR NOT
    - Joins: allow a query to access serveral tables at once
        - Join condition is mostly foreign key to primary key
        - INNER JOIN:
            - Only include rows from each table that match search
        - LEFT JOIN:
            - Include all of left table and only those from right that match
        - RIGHT JOIN:
            - Include those from left that match and all of right
        - FULL JOIN:
            - Inlcude everything from both
        - Cross JOIN:
            - Every item from left to every item to right
    - Set Operators: Like joins but uses the results of a select instead of 2 tables data
        - Both queries Must have same num of cols and data types
        - UNION:
            - gives all rows that are found in either query without duplicates
        - UNION ALL:
            - gives all rows even duplicates
        - INTERSECT:
            - all rows in both queries no duplicates
        - EXCEPT:
            - all rows in first but not second
    - Sub Queries:
        - Run query based on condition of another query
        - Operators:
            - IN, NOT IN, EXISTS, ANY, ALL
        - Common Table Expression (CTE):
            - run a query in advance and put result in temp var to be used in main query
        
    ---------REFER TO SQL TEST FILES---------
    SELECT statement:
        - Get data from table
        - Returns a results set not a table
    INSERT statement:
        - insert values into table
    UPDATE statement:
        - modify value in table
        - SET  to change values
    DELETE:
        - delete a single row
    TRUNCATE:
        - deletes all rows in table
