Data:
    - .Net
        - Classes / Objects / Collections
        - Fields/Variables to store referenced to other data
    - Text formats like xml/json
        - heirarchical containers with attributes
    - Relational Database
        - Like a spreadsheet
            - no heirarchical structure
        - Represent identity with primary keys
        - Represent relationships with foreign keys
        - Tables / rows / columns
            - Unnormalized
                - Update anomaly : you modify all copies but miss one and data becomes inconsistant
                - Deletion anomaly : you delete one piece of data and it deletes additional data because of db structure
                - Insertian anomaly : your unable to store certain pieces of data without also having others
                - Slow searching / performance issues because unstructured data
            - Normalized : taking from unstructured to structured and follow rules
                - 6 Normal Forms : 1-3 are the practical ones
                    - 1NF
                        - all elements are atomic values, not lists/groups/sets. break them up to more rows
                        - each row must be unique
                        - adding new columns to split groups is not motivated and informally violates 1NF
                    - 2NF
                        - all cols which are not part of any candidate key, cannot have partial Dependency on any of the candidate keys
                        - all have to be fully dependent on every can candidate key
                        - if no composite keys, 1NF implies 2NF
                    - 3NF
                        - no non-CanKey column can depend on any other non-CanKey column
                        - No Transitive Dependency
                            - an indirect Dependency A -> B, B -> C so dep from A -> C

Referential Integrity: no broken references
    - every foreign key value should actually point to somthing in another table

Functional Dependency: a relationship between two pieces of data or attributes : (X -> Y) y is dependent on xs
    - for any value of X theres only one possible value of Y
    - Could be sets of columns not just individual columns

    - Candidate Key : a minimal set of col/attr that every other column is dependent on
        - minimal size : (not (name, phone) only (name) or (phone))
        - often set is just size 1 
        - the values of anu Candidate key can uniquely identify that row
            - if key has multiple columns, also can be called a composite key
    - Primary Key : one of the canidate keys to be official identifier
        - underline column to show its primary key
    - Foreign Key : a copy of the primary key to reference the row in another table

SQL : Structured Query Language
    - allows very abstract operations in a relation db
    - Variants:
        - MySQL
        - PostgreSQL - open source
        - Oracle SQL - used by java
        - SQLite - lightweight
        - *SQL Server (Transact-SQL) - Microsoft .NET
            - sql server is software/runtime
            - t-sql is language
            - connects to .NET with Object-relational mapper(ORM)
                - ORM is called Entity Framework
